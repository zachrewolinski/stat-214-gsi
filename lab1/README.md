# Lab 1: PECARN TBI Data

Lab 1 is due at 11:59pm on Friday, February 21st. All students are recommended to begin as soon as possible.

The first thing students should do is read through the [Lab 1 instructions](https://github.com/zachrewolinski/stat-214-gsi/blob/main/lab1/instructions/lab1-instructions.pdf). Students should also make sure they are familiar with the [general lab instructions](https://github.com/zachrewolinski/stat-214-gsi/blob/main/discussion/week1/lab-instructions.pdf). Between these two sets of instructions, there should be details covering:
- Setting up your `stat214` environment, if you have not done so already.
- General report-writing guidelines
- Figure guidelines
- Jupyter & LaTeX guidelines
- Submission requirements (**important**!!)
- Data information
- Required sections/subsections
- Grading criteria

We hope that this covers 95% of the questions you may have. If anything is unclear, please post on Ed. We note that if there are any conflicts between the two sets of instructions, *the lab-specific instructions take priority*. This means that if `lab-instructions.pdf` and `lab1-instructions.pdf` directly contradict each other, follow the instructions from `lab1-instructions.pdf`. Perhaps also post on Ed so that we can re-align the instructions.

Note that we have provided an [example lab report](https://github.com/zachrewolinski/stat-214-gsi/blob/main/lab1/instructions/example_lab_report.pdf). This lab report is from a few years ago, and is for a different task and dataset. The idea is **NOT** to show you *exactly* what your lab report should look like, nor is it to show you what a perfect lab report looks like (this lab report may not get full credit). Instead, the idea is to show the type of formatting and attention to detail that we expect.

We recommend doing the following within the first week:
- Read the Kupperman et al. [paper](https://github.com/zachrewolinski/stat-214-gsi/blob/main/lab1/documents/Kuppermann_2009_The-Lancet_000.pdf)
- Look through the [data documentation](https://github.com/zachrewolinski/stat-214-gsi/blob/main/lab1/data/TBI%20PUD%20Documentation%2010-08-2013.xlsx)
- Begin exploratory data analysis - can you find any inconsistencies in the data?

Cleaning this dataset is like digging a hole - the deeper you go, the more dirt you find! Get started early, and be sure to document any judgement calls you make along the way.
